# Autonomous Robotics Navigation Project

This project is an exploration into the world of Robot Operating System (ROS). Our main objective was to enhance our understanding of ROS, improve our robotics engineering skills, and strengthen our teamwork abilities through collaborative problem-solving and task delegation.

## Project Overview

This project revolves around programming a robot to complete a set of tasks that mimic real-world autonomous navigation and exploration scenarios. The tasks are listed below:

1. **Figure of Eight Navigation:** Program the robot to move in a figure-eight pattern around two stationary objects. This task enhances our understanding of robot navigation and control in the presence of obstacles.

2. **Environment Exploration:** In this task, the robot is tasked with exploring an unknown environment. The robot should be able to autonomously navigate through the space, avoiding obstacles and mapping its surroundings.

3. **Maze Navigation:** Building on the previous task, the robot is now required to navigate through a complex maze. This involves more advanced path planning and navigation strategies.

4. **Environment Exploration and Object Colour Detection:** This task combines the exploration of the environment with the additional challenge of object detection based on color. The robot must be able to identify specific objects within its environment based on their color.

5. **Combination of tasks 2, 3, and 4:** The final task requires the robot to combine all previously learned skills to explore an unknown environment, navigate a maze, and detect colored objects.

By completing these tasks, we were able to gain significant insights into how robots perceive their environment, make decisions based on that information, and execute those decisions to interact with their surroundings.
